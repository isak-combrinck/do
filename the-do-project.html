        <h1 id="the-do-project">The do Project</h1>
<p>The do Project defines a standard syntax for creating plain text <em>do lists</em> (like a to do list but with less postponing and more getting things done).</p>
<p>Let's start with an example of a simple do list; I will explain the syntax below.</p>
<pre><code><div>2019.10.07 Monday
- polish first draft for the do project
x write first draft for the do project
! don't update windows

Backlog
- create website for the do project
- test out the do project in real life

Wishlist
- create a compiler, do to html
</div></code></pre>
<p>From the example we see that the do list is divided into sections. A <strong>section</strong> is any block of text with an empty line above and below it; so basically a paragraph. Headings are a simple text to let you know what the coming section is about, when it's due, etc. A <strong>heading</strong> is simply the first line of text in a section.</p>
<p>Each section contains a number of tasks which can be in one of three states.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-</code> <strong>Do</strong>: something to get done.</li>
<li><code>x</code> <strong>Done</strong>: something that got done.</li>
<li><code>!</code> <strong>Cancelled</strong>: something that had to get done but did not get done.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this is saved in a file with the <code>.do</code> extension. <code>--filename.do</code> is the syntax for a do file, let's dissect the syntax of an example do file to make it more understandable.</p>
<pre><code><div>--2019-October.do
</div></code></pre>
<p>The first character in a file name represents its state (in this case <em>do</em>), all following characters have no special meaning. If the list is completed or cancelled we change the first character to reflect the change of state.</p>
<pre><code><div>x-2019-October.do
</div></code></pre>
<pre><code><div>!-2019-October.do
</div></code></pre>
<p>This helps makes folders with a lot of different do lists easier to manage as it groups files by their state (do, done, cancelled).</p>
