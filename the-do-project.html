<p>2019-12-16: Version 0.1.0 '<em>Working Draft</em>'</p>
<p><em>The Do Project</em> defines a standard syntax for creating plain text do lists.</p>
<p>This is a formal write-up of the syntax that I use for all my plain text do lists. I mostly use plain text do lists because I find them to fit well with the work I do. They are well suited for small programming projects and generally any kind of task that needs to get done on your computer.</p>
<p>Let's start with an example of a simple do list; I will explain the syntax below.</p>
<pre><code><code><div>2019-10-7 Monday
- publish first draft for the do project
x write first draft for the do project
! polish first draft for the do project

Backlog
- create a page for the do project

Wishlist
- create a compiler, do to html
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>From the example we see that the do list is divided into sections. A <em>section</em> is any block of text with an empty line above and below it; so basically a paragraph. Headings are a simple text to let you know what the coming section is about, when it's due, etc. A <em>heading</em> is simply the first line of text in a section.</p>
<p>Each section contains a number of tasks which can be in one of three states.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-</code> <strong>Do</strong>: something to get done.</li>
<li><code>x</code> <strong>Done</strong>: something that got done.</li>
<li><code>!</code> <strong>Cancelled</strong>: something that had to get done but did not get done.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can save your do lists with whatever extension you want. <code>.txt</code> and <code>.md</code> are good options and you can even use the <code>.do</code> extension if you want to be cool. <code>--filename.txt</code> is the syntax I use for my do files. Let me dissect the syntax of an example do file to make it more understandable.</p>
<pre><code><code><div>--2019-October.txt
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>The first character in a file name represents its state (in this case <em>do</em>), all following characters have no special meaning. If the list is completed or cancelled we change the first character to reflect the change of state.</p>
<pre><code><code><div>x-2019-October.txt
</div></code></code></pre>
<pre><code><code><div>!-2019-October.txt
</div></code></code></pre>
<p>This helps makes folders with a lot of different do lists easier to manage as you can groups files by their state (do, done, cancelled).</p>
