<h1>The Do Project</h1>
<p>
    [0.1.1] <em>Concept</em> - 2019-12-16
    <br><br>
    <em>The Do Project</em> defines a standard syntax for creating plain text do lists.
    <br><br>
    This is a formal write-up of the syntax that I use for all my plain text do lists. I mostly use plain text do lists because I find them a good fit to the work I do. They are well suited for small programming projects and generally any kind of task that needs to get done on a computer.
    <br><br>
    Let's start with an example of a simple do list; I will explain the syntax below.
</p>

<code>2019-10-7 Monday

<p>
    From the example we see that the do list is divided into sections. A <em>section</em> is any block of text with an empty line above and below it; so basically a paragraph. Headings are a simple text to let you know what the coming section is about, when it's due, etc. A <em>heading</em> is simply the first line of text in a section.
    <br><br>
    Each section contains a number of tasks which can be in one of three states.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>-</strong> <em>Do</em>: something to get done.<br>
    <strong>x</strong> <em>Done</em>: something that got done.<br>
    <strong>!</strong> <em>Cancelled</em>: something that had to get done but did not get done.
</p>
<p>
    You can save your do lists with whatever extension you want. Common extensions like <code>.txt</code> and <code>.md</code> are good options and you can even use the <code>.do</code> extension if you want to be cool. <code>--filename.txt</code> is the syntax I use for my do files. Let me dissect the syntax of an example do file to make it more understandable.
    <br>
</p>

<code>--2019-October.txt</code>

<p>
    The first character in a file name represents its state (in this case <em>do</em>), all following characters have no special meaning. If the list is completed or cancelled we change the first character to reflect the change of state.
</p>

<code>x-2019-October.txt

!-2019-October.txt
</code>

<p>
    This helps make folders with a lot of different do lists easier to manage as you can groups files by their state (do, done, cancelled).
    <br><br>
    That's it! I hope it helps you be more productive.
